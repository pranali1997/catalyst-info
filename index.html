    ~`Introduction
        Project Catalyst aims at providing a compilation of best practices in key aspects of developing, deploying and monitoring mutiple services in the form of documentation and ready to run code that implemnts these. Project catalyst containes many starter kits.

    What is starter kit :
        Starter kit a complete project setup that covers the sample use cases and best practices curated by opiniated thoughtworkers.
        It provide sensible defaults for destributed service setup, best security practices and static code analysis tools.

    Why Catalyst
        If we see in many of the project aside from main logic of the code, we ned to implement many features which takes around weeks of developer's time also have similar structure in many projects. Catalyst provides different starter kits which provides those features which we can adopt in main logic of our project in just few days.

    Example 
        Let's take an example of catalyt-infra-starter, suppose we want to add an network module in the project.
        We can to make look into two places,
           1. terraform netwok module
           2. terragrunt network module
    change the variables according to requirement in environments/dev/network/input.hcl file.
